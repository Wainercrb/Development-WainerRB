                        The Institute for International Sport was founded by Dan Doyle on July 1, 1986. The Institute's mission is to use sport and the arts as mediums to forge meaningful ties on a global scale, and address critical societal issues. The mission has been carried out through renowned programs such as the World Scholar-Athlete Games, National Sportsmanship Day, Belfast United, The Renaissance Games, and many other initiatives that have touched lives in virtually every country in the world.
                        <br /><br /> On July 1, 2011, General Colin Powell delivered the Institute's 25th anniversary address at the World Scholar-Athlete Games. General Powell helped announce the Institute's vision for the future. This website provides details of that vision, including the creation of the Institute's Documentary and Music Division.For this roundup weâ€™ve prepared 30 fresh, brilliant and useful HTML5 tutorials from 2012 ranging from basic element explanation to advanced case studies.
